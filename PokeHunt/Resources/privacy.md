## **Privacy Policy**

##### This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. The PokeHunt app deals with location and the PokeHunt team (“We”) knows that an important concern for most anyone using location-based services is privacy. We want everyone to feel comfortable, which is why we’ve written this description of our privacy ethos – the guiding principles that inform how we develop our service and the decisions we make.
##### Please, read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your PII in accordance with our app.

##### **Personal Identifiable Information You Provide to Us**

##### We receive the information that may identify you as PokemonGo player. When registering in our app, you login with your Google or Pokemon Club accounts through secured protocols, so we do NOT keep your private information. We do NOT save your history for tracking purposes either. We do NOT send any promotional emails/newsletters to you.
##### We highly recommend NOT to use this tool with your main account as using this app is against the ToS of the Pokemon Go game. You can get banned, so please use this app at your own risk.

##### **Determining and Sharing Location**

##### *Determining your location* - PokeHunt deals with location, so in order to work, the PokeHunt needs to know your location. Whenever you open and use/interact with our app on your mobile device, we use the location information from your mobile device to tailor services to your current location (i.e., we’ll show you pokemons, pokestops and jyms within the defined steps area). This information is NOT shared with others. We are NOT using your mobile device “background location” to save your battery charge.
##### *Sharing Location with PokeHunt* – Your real-time location is not shared on the PokeHunt app. Your location data can ONLY be shared with others if you decide to post screenshot from your mobile device in social media.

##### **Sharing to Third Party Services (i.e., Twitter, Facebook and Instagram)**

##### *Social media* - Our app gives you an option of sharing your activity to your Twitter, Facebook, Instagram accounts. Please remember, when you make a post, all included to it information will be viewable by the communities on those services.
##### *Analytics* – To make constant improvements to our app we use several third party tools, namely Google Analytics and HockeyApp. First one helps us to analyze does the app suites your needs well and the second one shows us that PokeHunt permanently delivers service as it is expected. The Google analytics collect standard app log information and user behavior in anonymous form as NO PII is collected about you. The collected information about session use is then transmitted to Google for compiling statistical reports, which are heavily important to us as we want to make PokeHunt better for you. We want our app to provide non-stop correct service, but still we are not 100% insured from human-based errors. To track and quickly fix our mistakes we use HockeyApp that collects data on crashes.
##### *Advertisement* – We use AdMob framework to present the advertisement in our app. Please note that according to AdMob privacy policy Google may use the advertising ID from the device on which the ad is serving to generate interests and demographics (for example, 'sports enthusiasts'). Interests and demographics may be used to serve better targeted ads to the user.

##### **Information We Receive from Third Party Services**

##### We use the information from NianticLabs to show the pokemons, pokestops and jyms which are near you. You can block presentation of each of this items within settings in PokeHunt app.

##### **Questions or Concerns**

##### If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy using the PokeHunt, please send a detailed message to: pokehuntapp@gmail.com. We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.
