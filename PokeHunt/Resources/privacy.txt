Privacy Policy

This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our app. 

Warning

Using this software is against the ToS of the Pokemon Go game. You can get banned, so use this tool at your own risk and do not use your main account, if possible.

How do we protect your information

When registering in our app, you login with your Google or Pokemon Club accounts through secured protocols, so we do not keep your private information.
We do not save your history for tracking purposes either.
